# Semantic Background

This repository contains Semantic Web ontologies and vocabularies frequently used by members of [KurrawongAI](https://kurrawong.ai). 

We maintain the currency of these artifacts as best we can so this is a one-stop-shop for most of our daily Semantic Web reference object needs!
