    schema:description
        "\"Absorbed Dose\" (also known as Total Ionizing Dose, TID) is a measure of the energy deposited in a medium by ionizing radiation. It is equal to the energy deposited per unit mass of medium, and so has the unit \\(J/kg\\), which is given the special name Gray (\\(Gy\\))."^^<http://qudt.org/schema/qudt/LatexString> ,
        "Note that the absorbed dose is not a good indicator of the likely biological effect. 1 Gy of alpha radiation would be much more biologically damaging than 1 Gy of photon radiation for example. Appropriate weighting factors can be applied reflecting the different relative biological effects to find the equivalent dose. The risk of stoctic effects due to radiation exposure can be quantified using the effective dose, which is a weighted average of the equivalent dose to each organ depending upon its radiosensitivity. When ionising radiation is used to treat cancer, the doctor will usually prescribe the radiotherapy treatment in Gy. When risk from ionising radiation is being discussed, a related unit, the Sievert is used." ;

<http://qudt.org/vocab/quantitykind/Action>
    schema:description """An action is usually an integral over time. But for action pertaining to fields, it may be integrated over spatial variables as well. In some cases, the action is integrated along the path followed by the physical system.  If the action is represented as an integral over time, taken a the path of the system between the initial time and the final time of the development of the system.
The evolution of a physical system between two states is determined by requiring the action be minimized or, more generally, be stationary for small perturbations about the true evolution. This requirement leads to differential equations that describe the true evolution. Conversely, an action principle is a method for reformulating differential equations of motion for a physical system as an equivalent integral equation. Although several variants have been defined (see below), the most commonly used action principle is Hamilton's principle.""" ;

For example, if one petroleum liquid is less dense than another, it has a greater API gravity. Although API gravity is mathematically a dimensionless quantity (see the formula below), it is referred to as being in 'degrees'. API gravity is graduated in degrees on a hydrometer instrument.

Mathematically, the torque on a particle (which has the position r in some reference frame) can be defined as the cross product: \\(τ = r x F\\)

r is the particle's position vector relative to the fulcrum
F is the force acting on the particles,

Turbidity in open water is often caused by phytoplankton and the measurement of turbidity is a key test of water quality. The higher the turbidity, the higher the risk of the drinkers developing gastrointestinal diseases, especially for immune-compromised people, because contaminants like virus or bacteria can become attached to the suspended solid. The suspended solids interfere with water disinfection with chlorine because the particles act as shields for the virus and bacteria. Similarly suspended solids can protect bacteria from UV sterilisation of water. Fluids can contain suspended solid matter consisting of particles of many different sizes. While some suspended material will be large enough and heavy enough to settle rapidly to the bottom container if a liquid sample is left to stand (the settleable solids), very small particles will settle only very slowly or not at all if the sample is regularly agitated or the particles are colloidal.

As a result, solids typically expand in response to heating and contract on cooling; this dimensional response to temperature change is expressed by its coefficient of thermal expansion.

Different coefficients of thermal expansion can be defined for a substance depending on whether the expansion is measured by:

    * linear thermal expansion
    * area thermal expansion
    * volumetric thermal expansion

These characteristics are closely related. The volumetric thermal expansion coefficient can be defined for both liquids and solids. The linear thermal expansion can only be defined for solids, and is common in engineering applications.

Some substances expand when cooled, such as freezing water, so they have negative thermal expansion coefficients. [Wikipedia]""" ;

In such cases it is conventional to choose the reference point to be the center of mass of the system or the center of charge, not some arbitrary origin. This convention ensures that the dipole moment is an intrinsic property of the system.

Polarization occurs when an electric field distorts the negative cloud of electrons around positive atomic nuclei in a direction opposite the field. This slight separation of charge makes one side of the atom somewhat positive and the opposite side somewhat negative. In some materials whose molecules are permanently polarized by chemical forces, such as water molecules, some of the polarization is caused by molecules rotating into the same alignment under the influence of the electric field. One of the measures of polarization is electric dipole moment, which equals the distance between the slightly shifted centres of positive and negative charge multiplied by the amount of one of the charges.
