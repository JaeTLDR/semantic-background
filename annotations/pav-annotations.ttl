For instance, a curator (pav:curatedBy) might have consulted figures in a published paper to confirm that a dataset was correctly pav:importedFrom the paper's supplementary CSV file.

Another example: I can access the page for tomorrow weather in Boston (http://www.weather.com/weather/tomorrow/Boston+MA+02143)  and I can blog ‘tomorrow is going to be nice’. The source does not make any claims about the nice weather, that is my interpretation; therefore the blog post has pav:sourceAccessedAt the weather page. """@en ;

For instance a news article updated to correct factual information would point to the previous version of the article with pav:previousVersion. If however the content has significantly changed so that the two resources no longer share lineage (say a new article that talks about the same facts), they can instead be related using pav:derivedFrom.

This property is normally used in a functional way, although PAV does not formally restrict this. Earlier versions which are not direct ancestors of this resource may instead be provided using the superproperty pav:hasEarlierVersion.

A version number of this resource can be provided using the data property pav:version.

To indicate that this version is a snapshot of a more general, non-versioned resource, e.g. "Weather Today" vs. "Weather Today on 2013-12-07", see pav:hasVersion.

Note that it might be confusing to indicate pav:previousVersion from a resource that also has pav:hasVersion or pav:hasCurrentVersion relations, as such resources are intended to be a long-living and "unversioned", while pav:previousVersion is intended for use between permalink-like "snapshots" arranged in a linear history.

Import means that the content has been preserved, but transcribed somehow, for instance to fit a different representation model by converting formats. Examples of import are when the original was JSON and the current resource is RDF, or where the original was an document scan, and this resource is the plain text found through OCR.

The imported resource does not have to be complete, but should be consistent with the knowledge conveyed by the original resource.

If additional knowledge has been contributed, pav:derivedFrom would be more appropriate.

If the resource has been copied verbatim from the original representation (e.g. downloaded), use pav:retrievedFrom.

To indicate which agent(s) performed the import, use pav:importedBy. Use pav:importedOn to indicate when it happened. """@en ;

    schema:description """An agent primary responsible for making the digital artifact or resource representation.

This property is distinct from forming the content, which is indicated with pav:contributedBy or its subproperties; pav:authoredBy, which identifies who authored the knowledge expressed by this resource; and pav:curatedBy, which identifies who curated the knowledge into its current form.

pav:createdBy is more specific than its superproperty dct:creator - which might or might not be interpreted to cover this creator.

For instance, the author wrote 'this species has bigger wings than normal' in his log book. The curator, going through the log book and identifying important knowledge, formalizes this as 'locus perculus has wingspan > 0.5m'. The creator enters this knowledge as a digital resource in the knowledge system, thus creating the digital artifact (say as JSON, RDF, XML or HTML).

A different example is a news article. pav:authoredBy indicates the journalist who wrote the article. pav:contributedBy can indicate the artist who added an illustration. pav:curatedBy can indicate the editor who made the article conform to the news paper's style. pav:createdBy can indicate who put the article on the web site.

The software tool used by the creator to make the digital resource (say Protege, Wordpress or OpenOffice) can be indicated with pav:createdWith.

The date the digital resource was created can be indicated with pav:createdOn.

The location the agent was at when creating the digital resource can be made using pav:createdAt."""@en ;
