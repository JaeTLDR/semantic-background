    schema:description """Land use mapping in Australia is coordinated by the Australian Collaborative Land Use and Management Program (ACLUMP), a consortium of state and national agencies. Mapping is conducted at two scales: national scale and catchment scale. Land use is mapped according to the nationally agreed Australian Land Use and Management (ALUM) Classification, a three-tier hierarchical structure.

* National scale land use mapping is produced by ABARES using coarse-scale satellite data (pixel size of 1.1 square kilometres), ABS agricultural statistics and ground control point data for the agricultural land uses and various other digital maps, including the finer resolution catchment scale land use data, for the non-agricultural land uses. National scale (1:2 500 000) land use datasets have been compiled for 1992-93, 1993-94, 1996-97, 1998-99, 2000-01, 2001-02, 2005-06, 2010-11.
* Catchment scale land use mapping is produced by the state and territory agencies using land tenure and other types of land use data, fine-scale satellite data and information collected in the field. The operational scale of catchment scale land use mapping varies according to the intensity of land-use activities and landscape context. Mapping ranges from fine scale (1:10 000 to 1:25 000) for irrigated and peri-urban areas to coarser scales for cropping regions (1:100 000) and for the semi-arid and arid pastoral zone (1:250 000). Catchment scale mapping is compiled into a national raster (50m) dataset by ABARES as new datasets are available from the jurisdictions.

It was developed from multiple forest, vegetation and land cover data inputs, including contributions from Australian, state and territory government agencies and external sources.

A forest is defined in this dataset as _"An area, incorporating all living and non-living components, that is dominated by trees having usually a single stem and a mature or potentially mature stand height exceeding two metres and with existing or potential crown cover of overstorey strata about equal to or greater than 20 per cent. This includes Australia's diverse native forests and commercial plantations, regardless of age. It is also sufficiently broad to encompass areas of trees that are sometimes described as woodlands"_.

The dataset was compiled by the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences (ABARES) for the [National Forest Inventory](http://www.agriculture.gov.au/abares/forestsaustralia/Pages/Australia%27s-National-Forest-Inventory.aspx) (NFI), a collaborative partnership between the Australian and state and territory governments. The role of the NFI is to collate, integrate and communicate information on Australia's forests. States and territories agencies collect forest data using independent methods and at varying scales or resolutions. The NFI applies a national classification to state and territory data to allow seamless integration of these datasets. Multiple independent sources of external data are used to fill data gaps and improve the quality of the final dataset.

The NFI classifies forests into three national forest categories (Native forest, Commercial plantation, and Other forest) and then into various forest types. Commercial plantations presented in this dataset were sourced from the [National Plantation Inventory](http://www.agriculture.gov.au/abares/forestsaustralia/plantation-inventory-and-statistics) (NPI) spatial dataset (2016), also produced by ABARES. Another dataset produced by ABARES, the [Catchment scale Land Use and Management](http://www.agriculture.gov.au/abares/aclump/Pages/land-use/data-download.aspx) (CLUM) dataset (2016) was used to identify and mask out land uses that are inappropriate to map as forest."""@en ;
