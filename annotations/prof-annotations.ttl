    schema:description """This vocabulary is for describing relationships between standards/specifications, profiles of them and supporting artifacts such as validating resources.

This model starts with [http://dublincore.org/2012/06/14/dcterms#Standard](dct:Standard) entities which can either be Base Specifications (a standard not profiling any other Standard) or Profiles (Standards which do profile others). Base Specifications or Profiles can have Resource Descriptors associated with them that defines implementing rules for the it. Resource Descriptors must indicate the role they play (to guide, to validate etc.) and the formalism they adhere to (dct:format) to allow for content negotiation. A vocabulary of Resource Roles are provided alongside this vocabulary but that list is extensible."""@en ;
