    rdfs:label "BIBFRAME vocabulary" ;
    schema:description """The Bibframe vocabulary consists of RDF classes and properties used for the description of 
            items cataloged principally by libraries, but may also be used to describe items cataloged by museums and archives. 
            Classes include the three core classes - Work, Instance, and Item - in addition to many more 
            classes to support description. Properties describe characteristics of the resource being 
            described as well as relationships among resources. For example: one Work
            might be a "translation of" another Work; an Instance may be an 
            "instance of" a particular Bibframe Work.  Other properties describe attributes of Works and Instances.  For
            example: the Bibframe property "subject" expresses an important attribute of a Work 
            (what the Work is about), and the property "extent" (e.g. number of pages) expresses an
            attribute of an Instance."""@en ;
