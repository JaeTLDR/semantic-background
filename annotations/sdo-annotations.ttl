[[EventSeries]] that included a number of sporting competitions as Events.

The nature of the association between the events in an [[EventSeries]] can vary, but typical examples could
include a thematic event series (e.g. topical meetups or classes), or a series of regular events that share a location, attendee group and/or organizers.

EventSeries has been defined as a kind of Event to make it easy for publishers to use it in an Event context without
worrying about which kinds of series are really event-like enough to call an Event. In general an EventSeries
may seem more Event-like when the period of time is compact and when aspects such as location are fixed, but
it may also sometimes prove useful to describe a longer-term series as an Event.

schema:SpecialAnnouncement

      with contextualized Web links and other structured data.  It represents an information update made by a
      locally-oriented organization, for example schools, pharmacies, healthcare providers,  community groups, police,
      local government.

For work in progress guidelines on Coronavirus-related markup see [this doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14ikaGCKxo50rRM7nvKSlbUpjyIk2WMQd3IkB1lItlrM/edit#).

The motivating scenario for SpecialAnnouncement is the [Coronavirus pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019%E2%80%9320_coronavirus_pandemic), and the initial vocabulary is oriented to this urgent situation. Schema.org
expect to improve the markup iteratively as it is deployed and as feedback emerges from use. In addition to our
usual [Github entry](https://github.com/schemaorg/schemaorg/issues/2490), feedback comments can also be provided in [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fpdFFxk8s87CWwACs53SGkYv3aafSxz_DTtOQxMrBJQ/edit#).


While this schema is designed to communicate urgent crisis-related information, it is not the same as an emergency warning technology like [CAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Alerting_Protocol), although there may be overlaps. The intent is to cover
the kinds of everyday practical information being posted to existing websites during an emergency situation.

Several kinds of information can be provided:

We encourage the provision of "name", "text", "datePosted", "expires" (if appropriate), "category" and
"url" as a simple baseline. It is important to provide a value for "category" where possible, most ideally as a well known
URL from Wikipedia or Wikidata. In the case of the 2019-2020 Coronavirus pandemic, this should be "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=2019-20\\_coronavirus\\_pandemic" or "https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q81068910".

For many of the possible properties, values can either be simple links or an inline description, depending on whether a summary is available. For a link, provide just the URL of the appropriate page as the property's value. For an inline description, use a [[WebContent]] type, and provide the url as a property of that, alongside at least a simple "[[text]]" summary of the page. It is
unlikely that a single SpecialAnnouncement will need all of the possible properties simultaneously.

We expect that in many cases the page referenced might contain more specialized structured data, e.g. contact info, [[openingHours]], [[Event]], [[FAQPage]] etc. By linking to those pages from a [[SpecialAnnouncement]] you can help make it clearer that the events are related to the situation (e.g. Coronavirus) indicated by the [[category]] property of the [[SpecialAnnouncement]].

Many [[SpecialAnnouncement]]s will relate to particular regions and to identifiable local organizations. Use [[spatialCoverage]] for the region, and [[announcementLocation]] to indicate specific [[LocalBusiness]]es and [[CivicStructure]]s. If the announcement affects both a particular region and a specific location (for example, a library closure that serves an entire region), use both [[spatialCoverage]] and [[announcementLocation]].

The [[about]] property can be used to indicate entities that are the focus of the announcement. We now recommend using [[about]] only
for representing non-location entities (e.g. a [[Course]] or a [[RadioStation]]). For places, use [[announcementLocation]] and [[spatialCoverage]]. Consumers of this markup should be aware that the initial design encouraged the use of [[about]] for locations too.

The basic content of [[SpecialAnnouncement]] is similar to that of an [RSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS) or [Atom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_(Web_standard)) feed. For publishers without such feeds, basic feed-like information can be shared by posting
[[SpecialAnnouncement]] updates in a page, e.g. using JSON-LD. For sites with Atom/RSS functionality, you can point to a feed
with the [[webFeed]] property. This can be a simple URL, or an inline [[DataFeed]] object, with [[encodingFormat]] providing
media type information, e.g. "application/rss+xml" or "application/atom+xml".

    schema:description "[[StatisticalVariable]] represents any type of statistical metric that can be measured at a place and time. The usage pattern for [[StatisticalVariable]] is typically expressed using [[Observation]] with an explicit [[populationType]], which is a type, typically drawn from Schema.org. Each [[StatisticalVariable]] is marked as a [[ConstraintNode]], meaning that some properties (those listed using [[constraintProperty]]) serve in this setting solely to define the statistical variable rather than literally describe a specific person, place or thing. For example, a [[StatisticalVariable]] Median_Height_Person_Female representing the median height of women, could be written as follows: the population type is [[Person]]; the measuredProperty [[height]]; the [[statType]] [[median]]; the [[gender]] [[Female]]. It is important to note that there are many kinds of scientific quantitative observation which are not fully, perfectly or unambiguously described following this pattern, or with solely Schema.org terminology. The approach taken here is designed to allow partial, incremental or minimal description of [[StatisticalVariable]]s, and the use of detailed sets of entity and property IDs from external repositories. The [[measurementMethod]], [[unitCode]] and [[unitText]] properties can also be used to clarify the specific nature and notation of an observed measurement. " ;

    schema:description "Anatomical features that can be observed by sight (without dissection), including the form and proportions of the human body as well as surface landmarks that correspond to deeper subcutaneous structures. Superficial anatomy plays an important role in sports medicine, phlebotomy, and other medical specialties as underlying anatomical structures can be identified through surface palpation. For example, during back surgery, superficial anatomy can be used to palpate and count vertebrae to find the site of incision. Or in phlebotomy, superficial anatomy can be used to locate an underlying vein; for example, the median cubital vein can be located by palpating the borders of the cubital fossa (such as the epicondyles of the humerus) and then looking for the superficial signs of the vein, such as size, prominence, ability to refill after depression, and feel of surrounding tissue support. As another example, in a subluxation (dislocation) of the glenohumeral joint, the bony structure becomes pronounced with the deltoid muscle failing to cover the glenohumeral joint allowing the edges of the scapula to be superficially visible. Here, the superficial anatomy is the visible edges of the scapula, implying the underlying dislocation of the joint (the related anatomical structure)" ;

2.) CSS Selectors - addresses content in the annotated page, e.g. via class attribute. Use the [[cssSelector]] property.

3.)  XPaths - addresses content via XPaths (assuming an XML view of the content). Use the [[xpath]] property.


For more sophisticated markup of speakable sections beyond simple ID references, either CSS selectors or XPath expressions to pick out document section(s) as speakable. For this
